# OpenHands Architecture

The OpenHands backend architecture is designed to support flexible and efficient agent interactions. Here's a detailed overview of its components and operation:

## System Architecture

The backend system consists of several key components:
- **Agent Service**: Manages agent instances and their lifecycle
- **Function Service**: Handles function registration and execution
- **Conversation Service**: Manages conversation state and history
- **Storage Service**: Handles persistent storage of conversations and data
- **Message Queue**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between components

## Flow Diagram

The flow diagram illustrates how requests are processed:
1. User sends a request to the backend
2. Request is validated and routed
3. Agent Service processes the request using appropriate functions
4. Results are stored and returned to the user

## Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram shows the detailed interaction between components:
1. User initiates a conversation
2. System loads or creates necessary agent instances
3. Agents process requests using available functions
4. Results are stored and conversation state is updated
5. Response is returned to the user

This architecture enables:
- Scalable agent management
- Flexible function integration
- Persistent conversation handling
- Efficient resource utilization
- Robust error handling
